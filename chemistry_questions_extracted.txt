8.7: Cr²⁺ is a stronger reducing agent than Fe²⁺, providing a reason based on d³ vs d⁵ configurations and their stability in aqueous medium (d³ is more stable than d⁵ in water due to CFSE).
8.9: Disproportionation of Cu⁺ in aqueous solution (2Cu⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)) and mentions that the E⁰ value for this reaction is favourable.
8.10: 5f electrons are more effectively shielded from nuclear charge, meaning they provide poor shielding from element to element in the series.
