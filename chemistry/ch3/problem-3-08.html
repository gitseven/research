      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>The conductivity of 0.20 M solution of KCl at 298 K is 0.0248 S cm⁻¹. Calculate its molar conductivity.</p>

      <h2>Background Concept</h2>
      <p>Molar conductivity provides a concentration-normalised measure of a solution’s ability to conduct electricity and allows meaningful comparison between electrolytes and concentrations. It is defined as Λ<sub>m</sub> = κ × (1000/C), where κ is the specific conductivity in S cm⁻¹ and C is the molar concentration in mol L⁻¹; the factor 1000 converts litres to cubic centimetres. Physically, κ depends on both the number of charge carriers (ionic concentration) and their mobilities (influenced by ion size, solvation, and solvent viscosity). For a strong 1:1 electrolyte like KCl, complete dissociation is assumed over a wide concentration range, but inter-ionic interactions (ionic atmosphere and electrophoretic effects) still reduce mobility at higher concentrations. As the solution is diluted, these interactions diminish, so Λ<sub>m</sub> increases and approaches the limiting value Λ<sub>m</sub>⁰ at infinite dilution, where ions migrate independently (Kohlrausch’s law). In contrast, κ may decrease with dilution because the number of charge carriers per unit volume falls more rapidly than mobility rises. Hence, Λ<sub>m</sub> is the more appropriate metric when comparing different concentrations of the same electrolyte. Temperature control is crucial: higher temperature generally increases ion mobility (lower viscosity), raising both κ and Λ<sub>m</sub>. In practice, to compute Λ<sub>m</sub> one first calibrates the cell constant using a standard KCl solution of known conductivity, measures the sample’s resistance to obtain κ, and then applies the formula above with the sample concentration. The resulting units, S cm² mol⁻¹, reflect the conductance contribution per mole of electrolyte dispersed uniformly in solution.</p>

      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>Λ<sub>m</sub> = 0.0248 × (1000/0.20) = 0.0248 × 5000 = <strong>124 S cm² mol⁻¹</strong>.</p>
