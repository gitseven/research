      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>The resistance of a conductivity cell containing 0.001 M KCl solution at 298 K is 1500 Ω. What is the cell constant if conductivity of 0.001 M KCl solution at 298 K is 0.146 × 10⁻³ S cm⁻¹?</p>

      <h2>Background Concept</h2>
      <p>Conductivity measurements require translating an observed electrical resistance into a material property of the solution. The bridge between these is the <em>cell constant</em> G* (cm⁻¹), which captures the geometry of the conductivity cell: G* = l/A, the ratio of electrode separation l to electrode area A. The specific conductivity κ (S cm⁻¹) of the solution is then κ = G* / R, where R is the measured resistance, or equivalently G* = κ × R. Because real cells deviate from ideal parallel-plate geometry (edge effects, field fringing, electrode surface roughness), G* is determined by <em>calibration</em> using a standard solution with accurately known κ, most commonly aqueous KCl at specified molarities and temperature. After calibration, subsequent measurements in unknown solutions at the same temperature yield κ via the same cell, assuming electrode cleanliness and stable surface conditions. Temperature control matters because κ is sensitive to temperature through ion mobility and viscosity; therefore, both calibration and measurement should be performed at the same temperature, usually 298 K. Additionally, AC measurements mitigate electrode polarisation, and the chosen frequency is selected to minimise capacitive and Faradaic artefacts. In summary, the cell constant converts a raw resistance reading into a robust, geometry-independent conductivity value, enabling quantitative comparisons across solutions and instruments.</p>

      <p>G* = 0.146×10⁻³ × 1500 = <strong>0.219 cm⁻¹</strong>.</p>
