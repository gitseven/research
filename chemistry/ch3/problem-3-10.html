      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>The conductivity of 0.001 mol L⁻¹ acetic acid is 4.95 × 10⁻⁵ S cm⁻¹. Calculate its dissociation constant if Λ<sub>m</sub>⁰ for acetic acid is 390.5 S cm² mol⁻¹.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Background Concept</h2>
      <p>Conductometric methods allow us to infer the extent of ionisation of weak acids from their ability to conduct electricity. The <em>molar conductivity</em> Λ<sub>m</sub> measures the contribution of one mole of electrolyte to the total conductivity of the solution and is given by Λ<sub>m</sub> = κ × (1000/C). For a weak monoprotic acid HA that partially dissociates into H⁺ and A⁻, the degree of dissociation α is the fraction of HA molecules that ionise. Because conductivity arises only from ions, Λ<sub>m</sub> scales with the number and mobility of ions present; at a given temperature, mobilities are fixed, so Λ<sub>m</sub> is proportional to α when referenced to the limiting (infinite dilution) value Λ<sub>m</sub>⁰, where ions migrate independently. Thus, α = Λ<sub>m</sub>/Λ<sub>m</sub>⁰. Ostwald’s dilution law relates the acid dissociation constant to α and C: K<sub>a</sub> = C α²/(1−α) for a monoprotic weak acid, valid at low ionic strength where activity coefficients are near unity. As the solution is diluted, α increases markedly for weak acids, so Λ<sub>m</sub> rises steeply and tends toward Λ<sub>m</sub>⁰. In practice, one measures κ, computes Λ<sub>m</sub>, estimates α relative to a tabulated Λ<sub>m</sub>⁰ (from limiting ionic conductivities of H⁺ and the conjugate base), and then evaluates K<sub>a</sub>. Care must be taken with temperature control and contamination by CO₂, which can alter conductivity via carbonic acid formation. This approach provides an independent route to acidity constants that complements pH-based and spectrophotometric methods.</p>
      <div class="formula">Λ<sub>m</sub> = κ × (1000/C);  α = Λ<sub>m</sub>/Λ<sub>m</sub>⁰;  K<sub>a</sub> ≈ C α² /(1−α)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>Λ<sub>m</sub> = 4.95×10⁻⁵ × (1000/0.001) = 49.5 S cm² mol⁻¹; α = 49.5/390.5 = 0.127. K<sub>a</sub> ≈ 0.001 × 0.127² / (1−0.127) ≈ <strong>1.85 × 10⁻⁵</strong>.</p>
