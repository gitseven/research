    <h1>d- and f-Block Elements · Problem 8.8</h1>

      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>What are the characteristics of the transition elements and why are they called transition elements? Which of the d‑block elements may not be regarded as the transition elements?</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Background Concept — Defining Features of Transition Metals</h2>
      <p>Transition elements are those whose atoms or common ions possess a partially filled (n−1)d subshell. This definition captures the characteristic properties that arise from accessible d orbitals: variable oxidation states (d electrons can be lost/participate in bonding over several levels), formation of coloured compounds (d–d transitions and charge‑transfer bands), paramagnetism (unpaired d electrons), and pronounced catalytic activity (variable valence, adsorption to surfaces, and availability of multiple coordination sites). They form extensive coordination chemistry with a wide variety of ligands, display notable crystal‑field and ligand‑field effects (high‑spin/low‑spin, Jahn–Teller distortions), and often have high enthalpies of atomisation, densities, and melting points due to strong metallic bonding with d‑orbital overlap. The term “transition” reflects their position bridging the s‑ and p‑blocks, as properties evolve across the d series and transition into those of main‑group elements. Not all d‑block elements always meet the “partially filled d” criterion in their chemistry; for example, Zn, Cd, and Hg possess d¹⁰ configurations in the common oxidation state (+2), leading to diamagnetic, colourless salts with limited variable valency—hence they are often excluded from the strict definition of transition elements, despite occupying the d‑block. Borderline cases (e.g., Cu, Ag, Au) do show partially filled d in some oxidation states and are considered transition elements.</p>

      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Characteristics: variable oxidation states, coloured compounds, paramagnetism, catalytic activity, complex formation, high atomisation enthalpies.</li>
        <li>They are “transition” because they bridge s‑ and p‑block properties across the d series.</li>
        <li>Zn, Cd, Hg (d¹⁰ in +2) are often not regarded as transition elements in the strict sense.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>State the “partially filled d” criterion for atoms or common ions.</li>
        <li>List hallmark properties (variable oxidation state, colour, magnetism, catalysis).</li>
        <li>Explicitly exclude Zn/Cd/Hg under the strict definition.</li>
