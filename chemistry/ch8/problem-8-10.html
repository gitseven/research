      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>What are the different oxidation states exhibited by the lanthanoids?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — Predominant +3 with Occasional +2 and +4</h2>
      <p>Lanthanoids (La–Lu) characteristically exhibit a dominant +3 oxidation state, arising from loss of the two 6s electrons and one 5d/4f electron, giving Ln³⁺ with contracted 4f orbitals that are core‑like and weakly involved in bonding. Nevertheless, several lanthanoids access +2 and +4 states when stabilised by lattice or complexation energies and favourable 4f electron counts. The +2 state is common for Eu and Yb (f⁷ and f¹⁴, respectively) and occurs for Sm, Tm, Dy under appropriate conditions. The +4 state is most accessible for Ce and Tb (and sometimes Pr), where achieving f⁰ (Ce⁴⁺) or half‑filled subshells confers stability; Pr⁴⁺ can be stabilised in oxides/fluorides. The relative inertness of 4f orbitals means ligand field effects are weaker than for d metals, so trends are dominated by lattice energies, solvation, and the special stability of f⁰, f⁷, and f¹⁴ configurations. These provide the key rationale for which ions display +2 or +4 in addition to +3.</p>

      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Predominant: +3 for all lanthanoids.</li>
        <li>+2: especially Eu²⁺, Yb²⁺ (also Sm²⁺, Tm²⁺, Dy²⁺ in some solids/solutions).</li>
        <li>+4: notably Ce⁴⁺ (f⁰), Tb⁴⁺; Pr⁴⁺ in certain compounds.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Anchor on +3 as the default; add +2 (Eu, Yb) and +4 (Ce, Tb) as exceptions.</li>
        <li>Justify with favoured f counts: f⁰, f⁷, f¹⁴.</li>
        <li>Mention weak ligand‑field influence on 4f; lattice/solvation dominate.</li>
      </ul>
