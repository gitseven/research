      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>What is lanthanoid contraction? What are the consequences of lanthanoid contraction?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — Poor Shielding of 4f Electrons</h2>
      <p>Lanthanoid contraction is the steady decrease in the ionic and atomic radii of the lanthanoid elements (La to Lu) with increasing atomic number. It arises because added 4f electrons shield the increasing nuclear charge poorly from outer electrons (5d/6s), so effective nuclear attraction grows and radii shrink. The contraction is about 10–15 pm across the series and has pervasive consequences. First, it renders 4d/5d transition metals of the same groups similar in size; for example, Zr and Hf have nearly identical radii, complicating their separation and giving closely similar chemistry (the “chemical twins”). Second, it increases the hardness and density of later lanthanoids and influences their complexation behaviour (smaller Ln³⁺ binds ligands more strongly). Third, it raises third‑row transition‑metal ionisation energies and strengthens metal–ligand bonds relative to second‑row analogues, affecting oxidation state stability and coordination geometries. Fourth, it shifts basicity and hydrolysis equilibria within the lanthanoids (early Ln³⁺ are more basic than late Ln³⁺). Finally, the contraction narrows gaps between d and s levels in heavier elements, enabling low‑spin preferences and distinct structural motifs. Recognising lanthanoid contraction helps rationalise periodic trends, separation challenges (e.g., Zr/Hf), and subtle differences across homologous transition‑metal series.</p>

      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Definition: Progressive decrease in radii from La³⁺ to Lu³⁺ due to poor 4f shielding.</li>
        <li>Consequences: Zr/Hf size similarity; stronger metal–ligand bonding in 5d vs 4d; changes in basicity, density, separation difficulty; altered oxidation‑state and complex stability trends.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Always cite poor 4f shielding as the cause.</li>
        <li>Use Zr–Hf similarity as the canonical example.</li>
        <li>Mention effects on bonding strength and separation chemistry.</li>
