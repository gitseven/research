      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>Explain briefly how +2 state becomes more and more stable in the first half of the first row transition elements with increasing atomic number?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — Trends in the +2 Oxidation State</h2>
      <p>Across the first transition series (Sc → Zn), the +2 oxidation state corresponds to removal of two ns electrons (4s²) and, for earlier elements, sometimes one or more (n−1)d electrons. In the <em>first half</em> (Sc to Mn), increasing atomic number fills the 3d subshell, raising effective nuclear charge experienced by valence electrons and strengthening metal–ligand interactions of the M²⁺ aqua/complex ions. Two energetic factors favour the growing stability of +2: (1) the third ionisation enthalpy (to form +3) tends to increase relative to hydration/lattice gains obtainable for M³⁺, and (2) crystal field stabilisation and exchange energies often favour particular d electron counts in the +2 state (notably d⁵ for Mn²⁺), rendering further oxidation less advantageous. In aqueous media, M³⁺ ions (particularly for early elements) are strongly hydrolysing and may be destabilised by solvation penalties and aquo complex acidity, biasing equilibria back to M²⁺. Thus, as we move from Ti (d²) to Mn (d⁵), the +2 state typically becomes thermodynamically more preferred vis‑à‑vis +3 or higher states, culminating near Mn²⁺, which is especially stable owing to the half‑filled d⁵ configuration (high exchange energy). The detailed trend is modulated by ligand field strength and solid‑state lattice energies in salts, but the overarching rationale—rising third ionisation cost and favourable d‑electron configurations—robustly explains the observed increase in +2 stability.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>From Sc→Mn, increasing 3d occupancy and rising third ionisation enthalpy, together with favourable CFSE/exchange (especially d⁵ for Mn²⁺), make M²⁺ progressively more stable relative to higher oxidation states in aqueous/ligand environments.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reference d‑electron counts: Ti²⁺(d²) → V²⁺(d³) → Cr²⁺(d⁴) → Mn²⁺(d⁵).</li>
        <li>Note d⁵ (Mn²⁺) high exchange stabilisation; +3 would be d⁴ and less favoured.</li>
        <li>Consider hydration and hydrolysis penalties for M³⁺ in water.</li>
