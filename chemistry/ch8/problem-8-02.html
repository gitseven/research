      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>Why are Mn compounds more stable than Fe towards oxidation to their +3 state?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — CFSE, Exchange Energy, and Ionisation</h2>
      <p>Across the first transition series, stability trends of oxidation states reflect a balance of lattice/solvation energies, crystal‑field stabilisation energy (CFSE), exchange energy from high‑spin configurations, and successive ionisation enthalpies. Manganese sits at d⁵ in Mn²⁺, a half‑filled configuration that enjoys maximised exchange energy and zero CFSE in both octahedral high‑spin and tetrahedral fields. Oxidising Mn²⁺ (d⁵) to Mn³⁺ (d⁴) forfeits part of that favourable exchange stabilisation and typically yields small CFSE benefits unless strong‑field ligands enforce low spin. Consequently, Mn³⁺ is thermodynamically less stabilised relative to Mn²⁺ and, when formed, is a potent oxidant in aqueous solution, readily reverting to Mn²⁺ (especially in the absence of strong complexation). Iron differs subtly: Fe²⁺ is d⁶ and Fe³⁺ is d⁵. Formation of Fe³⁺ gains the particularly stable half‑filled d⁵ configuration, providing strong exchange stabilisation; in many ligand fields, Fe³⁺ is thus relatively favoured compared with Fe²⁺. These contrasting electron‑count consequences mean that, in general aqueous chemistry, Mn compounds are less stable in +3 than Fe compounds are in +3, i.e., Mn³⁺ is more easily reduced back to Mn²⁺, while Fe³⁺ is comparatively stable. Complexation can modify these trends; strong‑field ligands (e.g., CN⁻) can stabilise higher oxidation states by increasing CFSE and lowering effective ionisation energies through covalency.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>Mn²⁺ (d⁵) is especially stable (half‑filled), so oxidation to Mn³⁺ (d⁴) is disfavoured; Fe³⁺ (d⁵) is stabilised relative to Fe²⁺ (d⁶). Hence, Mn(III) compounds are less stable (more easily reduced) than Fe(III) compounds in aqueous solution.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Compare d‑electron counts on oxidation: seek d⁵ half‑filled stability.</li>
        <li>Recall exchange energy favours high‑spin d⁵ strongly in weak fields.</li>
        <li>Consider ligand effects: strong‑field ligands can stabilise higher oxidation states.</li>
