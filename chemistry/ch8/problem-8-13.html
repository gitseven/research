      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>How is the variability in oxidation states of transition metals different from that of the non transition metals? Illustrate with examples.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — Accessible d Orbitals vs Octet Patterns</h2>
      <p>Transition metals display many oxidation states because their valence shell comprises both ns and (n−1)d orbitals with comparable energies. Electrons can be lost from ns and then (n−1)d, and d electrons can participate in metal–ligand bonding over several formal counts, especially with strong π‑acceptor ligands. As a result, series such as Mn show +2 through +7, Fe shows +2 and +3 widely, and elements like V and Cr access high states (+5, +6) in oxides/fluorides stabilized by strong M=O bonding and lattice energies. In contrast, main‑group elements typically follow octet‑driven patterns set by ns/np counts; variability exists (e.g., p‑block inert pair effect: Sn(II)/Sn(IV), Pb(II)/Pb(IV)), but the range is narrower and often limited to two common states. Moreover, main‑group oxidation states correlate strongly with group number and the inert pair effect down a group, whereas in transition metals, ligand field, covalency, and lattice/solvation energies play a larger role, decoupling simple group‑number predictions. The presence of multiple, closely spaced d‑derived states also underlies rich redox catalysis and electron‑transfer chemistry in the d‑block, contrasting with the more ionic, fixed‑valence chemistry of s/p elements in many settings.</p>

      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Transition: many accessible states (e.g., Mn: +2…+7; V: +2…+5; Cr: +2, +3, +6), tuned by ligands/CFSE.</li>
        <li>Main group: fewer common states, often two (e.g., Sn(II)/Sn(IV), Pb(II)/Pb(IV)) governed by inert‑pair effect.</li>
        <li>Drivers: d‑orbital participation, M=O/F bonding, lattice/solvation vs octet/inert‑pair considerations.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>List a broad d‑metal series (Mn or V/Cr) to show range.</li>
        <li>Contrast with a p‑block pair (Sn, Pb) for limited variability.</li>
        <li>Mention ligand effects (O²⁻/F⁻) and CFSE for d‑block flexibility.</li>
