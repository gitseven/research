      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>What are interstitial compounds? Why are such compounds well known for transition metals?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — Small Atoms in Metal Lattice Voids</h2>
      <p>Interstitial compounds are non‑stoichiometric materials formed when small atoms (H, B, C, N, sometimes O) occupy interstitial sites (octahedral/tetrahedral holes) within a metal lattice without destroying the host’s overall metallic framework. Transition metals readily form such phases because their close‑packed lattices (hcp, ccp, bcc) present abundant interstitial voids sized appropriately for these small atoms, and their partially filled d bands can accommodate charge redistribution and bonding without large structural penalties. The inserted atoms often engage in polar/metallic‑covalent interactions with surrounding metal atoms, strengthening the lattice and raising hardness, melting point, and elastic modulus while typically preserving metallic conductivity (since the metal sublattice remains continuous). Classic examples include TiC, VC, Fe₃C (cementite), and metal nitrides/carbides (e.g., Mo₂C, WC, VN), which are extremely hard, refractory, and chemically resilient—hence their use in cutting tools and wear‑resistant coatings. Hydrogen can occupy interstitial sites reversibly in some metals (PdHₓ), relevant to hydrogen storage and catalysis. Unlike true ionic or covalent stoichiometric compounds, interstitial phases frequently exhibit variable composition (x in MHₓ) reflecting partial occupancy of interstitial sites. The prevalence in transition metals stems from their robust metallic bonding, suitable void sizes, and the flexibility of d‑electron bonding to tolerate and stabilise embedded small atoms with minimal electronic localization that would otherwise disrupt conduction.</p>

      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>They are phases where small atoms (H, B, C, N) occupy interstitial holes in a metal lattice. Transition metals form them extensively due to abundant appropriately sized voids and adaptable d‑band metallic bonding, yielding hard, high‑melting, conductive materials (e.g., carbides, nitrides, hydrides).</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Define interstitial occupation and stress non‑stoichiometry.</li>
        <li>Cite examples (TiC, WC, VN, PdHₓ) and properties (hardness, high Tm).</li>
        <li>Connect to d‑band metallic bonding and close‑packed lattices.</li>
