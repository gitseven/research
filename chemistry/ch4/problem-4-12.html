    <div class="panel q">
      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>The reaction between A and B is first order with respect to A and zero order with respect to B. Fill in the blanks in the following table.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — Zero Order vs First Order Contributions</h2>
      <p>A rate law r = k[A]^1[B]^0 simplifies to r = k[A], indicating the rate depends linearly on A and is independent of B (within the range studied). Zero‑order dependence often arises when the surface or catalytic sites are saturated with B, so changing [B] does not alter the rate, or when a preceding fast equilibrium fixes the effective concentration of the reactive form of B. In problems that require filling a rate table, doubling [A] at constant [B] doubles the rate; doubling [B] at constant [A] leaves the rate unchanged. If both A and B are changed, only the change in [A] matters. For integrated kinetics under pseudo‑first‑order conditions (B zero‑order), the time course for A follows the first‑order expression, and a plot of ln[A] vs t is linear with slope −k. Recognising zero‑order behaviour is critical in catalytic kinetics and photochemistry, where flux‑limited regimes can make rates independent of reactant concentration.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>Rate law: r = k[A]. In the table, scale rates directly with [A] changes; ignore [B] changes (no effect).</p>
      <div class="formula">Examples: if [A] doubles → rate ×2; if [B] doubles → rate ×1 (no change)</div>
    </div>

      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Replace [B]^0 by 1 in the rate expression; drop [B] entirely.</li>
        <li>Check for linear ln[A] vs t to confirm first‑order decay in A.</li>
        <li>When in doubt, compute rate ratios: v₂/v₁ = ([A]₂/[A]₁)^1 ([B]₂/[B]₁)^0.</li>
