      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>What is the order of the reaction with respect to A and B?</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Background Concept — Determining Partial Orders</h2>
      <p>The order of a reaction with respect to a given reactant is the exponent of its concentration in the rate law. For a rate law of the form r = k[A]^n[B]^m, the <em>partial orders</em> are n (with respect to A) and m (with respect to B). These must be obtained experimentally because they reflect the mechanism’s kinetics rather than the overall stoichiometric equation. Two common experimental strategies are used. (1) <em>Initial rates method</em>: holding [B] constant while varying [A] allows one to measure how the initial rate scales with [A]; from v ∝ [A]^n, a log–log plot log v vs log [A] yields a slope equal to n. Repeating with [A] constant while varying [B] yields m. (2) <em>Isolation method</em>: keeping one reactant in large excess makes its concentration effectively constant, so the rate law reduces to pseudo‑order in the other reactant; time–course data then fit an integrated law (e.g., first‑order if n = 1) to determine the order. Additional checks include half‑life dependence (first order: t₁/₂ independent of [A]₀; second order: t₁/₂ ∝ 1/[A]₀) and linearity of integrated plots (e.g., ln[A] vs t). Once n and m are known, the overall order is n + m. Accurate determination requires temperature control (k is T‑dependent), constant ionic strength for ionic reactions, and avoiding side reactions or product inhibition during the initial rate window.</p>

      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p><strong>With respect to A:</strong> the exponent of [A] in the rate law (denote it n). <strong>With respect to B:</strong> the exponent of [B] (denote it m). Determine n and m from initial‑rates or isolation experiments.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use log v vs log [A] (B constant) to get slope = n; swap roles to get m.</li>
        <li>If one reactant is in large excess, fit a pseudo‑first/second‑order integrated plot to extract the order.</li>
        <li>Check half‑life behavior as a diagnostic of first vs second order.</li>
      </ul>
