      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>For a reaction, A + B → Product; the rate law is r = k[A]^n[B]^m. Write the order of the reaction.</p>

      <h2>Background Concept — Molecularity vs Order, Overall Order</h2>
      <p>The <em>order</em> of a reaction is an empirical quantity derived from the rate law, indicating how the instantaneous rate depends on reactant concentrations. For a general rate law r = k[A]^n[B]^m..., the <em>overall order</em> is the sum of exponents n + m + ..., while the <em>partial orders</em> are n with respect to A and m with respect to B. These exponents need not be integers and must be determined experimentally (e.g., via initial rates or isolation method), as they reflect the mechanism’s rate-determining step and may differ from stoichiometric coefficients. This contrasts with <em>molecularity</em>, a theoretical count of molecules involved in a single elementary event, which is inherently an integer and not directly measurable for complex reactions. Knowledge of orders guides integrated rate law selection (first order: ln[A] vs t linear; second order: 1/[A] vs t; zero order: [A] vs t) and informs half-life behavior and sensitivity to concentration changes. When catalysts, inhibitors, or complex formation are present, apparent orders can shift with conditions. Thus, when a rate law is provided, computing the overall order is straightforward: sum the concentration exponents. This quantity provides a compact descriptor of kinetic dependence and is essential for comparing and categorising reaction kinetics across systems.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sum the exponents of all concentration terms present in the rate law.</li>
        <li>Do not use stoichiometric coefficients unless the reaction is elementary and stated as such.</li>
        <li>Remember that orders may be fractional or zero; report the sum as given.</li>
