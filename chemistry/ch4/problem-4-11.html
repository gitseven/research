      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>Determine the rate law and the rate constant for the reaction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — Initial Rates and Isolation Methods</h2>
      <p>To deduce a rate law r = k[A]^n[B]^m from concentration–rate data, the initial rates method compares experiments where only one reactant concentration is changed at a time. Holding [B] constant, if the initial rate scales by a factor f when [A] is multiplied by g, then f = g^n, and n = log f / log g. Repeating with [A] held constant yields m. Once exponents are known, k is obtained by substituting any experiment’s initial rate and concentrations into the rate law. Alternatively, the isolation method sets one reactant in large excess so its concentration is effectively constant, reducing the rate to pseudo‑order in the limiting reactant; then an integrated plot (e.g., ln[A] vs t for first order, 1/[A] vs t for second order) reveals the order and provides k from the slope. Whichever approach is used, keep temperature constant (k is temperature‑dependent), correct for ionic strength if relevant, and ensure measurements are within the initial time window before significant depletion or product inhibition occurs. Dimensional analysis of k confirms the inferred overall order: for overall order n+m, units of k are (mol⁻¹ L)^(1−(n+m)) s⁻¹ in SI‑like molarity units.</p>

      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>From the provided experimental data (not shown here), determine n and m via initial rates or isolation, then compute k by substitution. Report r = k[A]^n[B]^m and k with appropriate units.</p>
      <div class="formula">Units check: overall order p → [k] = (mol L⁻¹)^{1−p} s⁻¹</div>
    </div>

      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use ratios of rates to cancel k and isolate exponents.</li>
        <li>Verify exponents by plotting transformed data (ln v vs ln [A]).</li>
        <li>Confirm k units match the deduced overall order.</li>
