    <div class="panel q">
      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>In a reaction, 2A → Products, the concentration of A decreases from 0.5 mol L⁻¹ to 0.4 mol L⁻¹ in 10 minutes. Calculate the rate during this interval.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — Stoichiometric Normalisation of Rate</h2>
      <p>For a general reaction aA → products, the experimentally measured rate based on reactant A must be normalised by its stoichiometric coefficient to provide a reaction-rate definition independent of which species is monitored. The convention ensures a single scalar rate that is positive for a forward reaction: v = −(1/a) Δ[A]/Δt for average rate (or v = −(1/a) d[A]/dt instantaneously). This matters whenever the balanced equation has coefficients other than one, such as 2A → products, where A disappears twice as fast as the reaction progress variable advances. Without normalisation, rates computed from different species would disagree by constant factors, hindering comparison with rate laws and kinetic parameters. In classroom problems, average rates are often requested over finite intervals between two concentration measurements; one computes Δ[A]/Δt and then applies the coefficient correction. Units should reflect amount per volume per time (e.g., mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹). Note that the rate law (e.g., first or second order) determines how the instantaneous rate depends on concentration but is not required to compute a finite-interval average rate. When comparing multiple intervals, decreasing slopes typically indicate the reaction is slowing as reactant is depleted, consistent with most rate laws that have positive concentration orders.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <div class="formula">Δ[A] = 0.4 − 0.5 = −0.1 mol L⁻¹; Δt = 10 min</div>
      <div class="formula">v = −(1/2) · Δ[A]/Δt = −(1/2) · (−0.1/10) = 0.005 mol L⁻¹ min⁻¹</div>
      <p>In SI seconds: 10 min = 600 s → v = 0.005 / 60 = <strong>8.33×10⁻⁵ mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Always divide by the stoichiometric coefficient of the monitored species.</li>
        <li>Keep sign conventions: Δ[A] is negative; the overall rate v is reported positive.</li>
        <li>Convert minutes to seconds when needed and match units with the requested output.</li>
      </ul>
