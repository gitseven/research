      <h2>Original Question</h2>
      <p>What is chelate effect? Give an example.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Background Concept — Thermodynamic Origin of Chelate Effect</h2>
      <p>The chelate effect is the enhanced stability of complexes containing multidentate (chelating) ligands compared to analogous complexes with equivalent numbers of similar monodentate ligands. When a bidentate ligand such as ethane‑1,2‑diamine (en) binds to a metal through two donor atoms, it forms a five‑membered ring that resists dissociation. Replacing two monodentate ligands (e.g., 2 NH₃) with one bidentate ligand (en) often increases complex stability significantly. The principal driving force is entropic: in an association reaction like [M(NH₃)₆]²⁺ + 3 en ⇌ [M(en)₃]²⁺ + 6 NH₃, one complex plus three bidentate ligands convert to one complex plus six monodentate ligands, releasing more particles (NH₃) into solution and increasing disorder (ΔS° > 0). Enthalpic factors can also contribute because chelate rings reduce the probability that all donor bonds break simultaneously, lowering the effective dissociation rate. Ring size matters; five‑ and six‑membered rings are generally favored because they minimize strain. Chelation affects kinetics (often inertness increases), solubility, and selectivity. In biological systems, polydentate chelators like porphyrins bind metal ions strongly (e.g., Fe in heme), and in analytical chemistry, EDTA (hexadentate) is used in titrations due to very large formation constants with many metal ions. Substituting monodentate donors with chelators shifts equilibria toward complex formation and can suppress precipitation or redox reactions by sequestering metal ions.</p>

      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p><strong>Chelate effect:</strong> The pronounced increase in stability observed when a metal binds multidentate (chelating) ligands instead of comparable monodentate ligands, mainly due to favorable entropy and ring formation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> [Ni(en)₃]²⁺ is far more stable than [Ni(NH₃)₆]²⁺ under similar conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Classic titrant:</strong> EDTA forms highly stable chelates with Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe³⁺, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Tips to Solve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mention “entropy increase” and “ring formation” explicitly.</li>
        <li>Give one clear example: EDTA complexes or [M(en)₃]²⁺ vs [M(NH₃)₆]²⁺.</li>
      </ul>
